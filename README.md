- Simulacion.ipynb is the initial conditions code for simulation of kirkwood gaps
  
- Generar_Graficos.ipynb is the code for the kirkwood gaps results

- medios_gabs.pdf is the Kirkwood Gaps article made in REBOUND

- ".npy" files are the positions (x and y) to use in "Generar_Graficos.ipynb", to avoid running the simulation for 5 hours!!
